            <p>
              BeepTalk serves as an intermediary platform where users connect and share. While we enforce Community Guidelines, users are solely responsible for the content they create, share, or engage with. BeepTalk will review reported violations, remove harmful or non-compliant content, and restrict accounts that breach these guidelines. However, BeepTalk is not responsible for third-party services or external platforms accessed through our app.

            <p>
              BeepTalk regularly reviews and updates these Guidelines to reflect evolving laws and community standards. If significant changes occur, users will be notified via in-app alerts, SMS, or email. By continuing to use BeepTalk after updates, you agree to the revised Guidelines. We encourage all users to review these policies periodically.
